Parking lot should have area for parking skateboards
with a sign denoting that skateboards can be parked
with ample signage it makes it easier to see where to park the skateboard
  BUT... why would someone want to park the skateboard instead of carrying around the skateboard
    ease of movement, by parking the skateboard, it is no longer held in the hands
    CLEANING ZONE, an attendant can clean the skateboard with the parker of the skateboard enjoys a walk
  BUT.. what if someone doesn't have a skateboard to park?
  Another sign can reveal a skateboard aquisition area
    BUT... how does someone buy the skateboard
      there are several ways for someone to buy a skate board at the skate board aquisition area, in the skateboarding parking region
        a person can be behind a booth seeling skateboards
        a skateboard vending machine 
        a GAME, a claw grab game with skateboards inside the machine
